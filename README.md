CODE LINK: https://github.com/tanseerahamed/bikesmith-niche-website-client-side


•	Home page  have a header (simple navbar), banner, products, reviews, and footer. On the home page, the products  have a maximum of 6 items/products. You can put one or more products in a row based on your design. Each product should have a relevant name, image, short description, add a purchase or buy now button. If a user clicks on the purchase or buy now button it will take the user to the purchase page.



•	We  have another page on the top navigation bar (header) mentioning explore (you can give it a meaningful name based on your website). Clicking on the link will take the user to the explore page. On this page, users will see all the products you have. This means, the user will see at least 10 products on this page. Each item  have a name, description, image, price and button. Once a user clicks on this button, it will take the user to the purchase page. 



•	The purchase page will be a private/protected route. Please make sure that if the user is not logged in, the private route redirects to the login page. After login, the user will be redirected to the page he/she wanted to go to. Also, make sure, after reloading the page of a private route, the user is not redirected to the login page. The purchase page should display detailed information of the item the user has clicked somewhere at the top. It will also display the user's name and email address from the login system and the user  have a field to provide address, phone number and necessary information to place the order or to complete the purchase. 



•	Implement email/ password (login/Register) based login system. The registration form should have the name and once a user is logged in, the user name, and the logout button should appear on the header which will log out the user once clicked. Displaying username on the header is optional. Please note that implementing the google, facebook, or github provider based authentication is also optional



•	If a user is logged in, he/she will see another option on the header is called Dashboard and inside that dashboard a normal user (not an admin) will see options like pay,My Orders, Review, Logout. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu items. The pay page will say: Payment system coming soon
